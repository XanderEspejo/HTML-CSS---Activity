            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student who enjoys creating websites and exploring how different technologies connect and work together.
                I'm always curious about how technology can be used to solve real-life problems and improve everyday life.

                            LCCM has been my school from the beginning of my education up to senior high.
                            It is also the place where my passion for technology was first sparked and nurtured,
                            inspiring me to explore projects in web development and beyond.

                            I enjoy playing basketball, boxing, and chess.
                            These sports challenge both my body and mind, helping me stay physically strong, sharpen my focus, 
                            and relieve stress. They keep me balanced and motivated in everything I do.
